# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction Project

This project is part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate on Coursera.

## 📘 Scenario

You are a Data Analyst working for a Real Estate Investment Trust. Your task is to analyze and predict housing prices using features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and more.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains house sales in King County, WA (including Seattle) from May 2014 to May 2015.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand and clean housing data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Use linear and polynomial regression to predict housing prices
- Apply Ridge regression with and without polynomial features
- Evaluate models using R² score

## ✅ Questions Answered

1. Display data types
2. Drop unnecessary columns and show statistical summary
3. Count unique floor values
4. Boxplot of price vs waterfront view
5. Correlation between sqft_above and price
6. Linear regression (sqft_living → price)
7. Linear regression using multiple features
8. Pipeline with polynomial regression
9. Ridge regression (regularization α=0.1)
10. Polynomial Ridge regression (degree=2)
