# King County Housing Price Prediction 🏠

This repository contains the final project for the **IBM Data Analysis with Python** course on Coursera.

## 🔍 Project Summary
The goal was to predict housing prices using a real dataset of homes sold in **King County, WA** (including Seattle) between May 2014 and May 2015.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
1. Displayed data types using `.dtypes`
2. Dropped unnecessary columns and generated statistical summaries
3. Counted houses based on number of floors
4. Visualized price outliers (waterfront vs. non-waterfront properties)
5. Explored correlation between `sqft_above` and price
6. Applied simple linear regression using `sqft_living`
7. Used multiple linear regression with 11 features
8. Created a pipeline with polynomial features (degree = 2)
9. Applied Ridge regression with α = 0.1
10. Used Ridge regression on polynomial-transformed features
