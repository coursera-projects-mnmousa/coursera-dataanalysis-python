This is the final project from the Coursera course **"Data Analysis with Python"** by IBM.

6. Applied simple linear regression using `sqft_living`
7. Used multiple linear regression with 11 features
8. Created a pipeline with polynomial features (degree = 2)
9. Applied Ridge regression with α = 0.1
10. Used Ridge regression on polynomial-transformed features
